  <p style="font-family:Times New Roman; color:#6A5F5F; font-size:50%;"> What is the history and origins of wi-fi you may ask? Well WI-FI started out as an american invention, specifically <br> the American Federal Communications Commission's or the 'FCC's descision to make their radio waves and signals open to the puplic.<br> The bands that were made open belonged to America's Telecom Regulators and it was a strange desicision seeing as <br> most other companies and businesses required govermental lisences to access them. This was the birth of wireless connectivity for the public, many people were involved and part of the devlopment of WI-FI and many different sources hold different peices of information revolving around the development of WI-FI. In our modern day around 8 out of 10 people in each country besides china own WI-FI and use it.
